I have a dream, which is to perform three competitions (Crossfit, Strongman, and Powerlifting) and WIN all of them within one year.  This application will do the following:

1. Details for competitions I want to compete in
2. Goals for the events within these competitions
3. My current best marks for the events within these competitions
4. A daily blog 
5. A nutritional application, where I can add what I eat and drink
6. A fitness application, where I can add what I trained

All of this will be built on Ruby on Rails (my first real foray into the technology), Backbone, Knockout, and DynamoDB
